# Minutes
A project that I worked on for my School District to keep track of minutes of PE that teachers enter. It keeps track of a 10 day period to show that they are meeting requirements. The 10 days are not the last 10 calendar days, but the last 10 days that entries were made to account for weekends and holidays.
